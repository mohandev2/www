            <h1>OpenHPI :: Status</h1>
            <p>
              OpenHPI is an open source project, so is continually a
              work in progress.  As OpenHPI 1.0 is a set of 56 APIs,
              which are fullfilled by both the OpenHPI infrastructure
              and OpenHPI plugins.  We will be providing tracking of
              the status of the APIs based on the following key.

                    hasn't been started yet, or is in a non operational state</td></tr>
                <tr><td class="notdone">Not Done</td><td>Functionality
                    is in progress.  It probably doesn't do what it
                    should, but it shouldn't crash the system.</td></tr>
                <tr><td class="semifunc">Semi Functional</td><td>Functionality
                    exists, but isn't guaranteed to work properly.
                    Considered alpha level functionality.</td></tr>
                <tr><td class="functional">Functional</td><td>Functionality
                    exists, and <em>should work</em>.  It has not be
                    extensively tested, and should be considered beta quality</td></tr>
                <tr><td class="done">Done</td><td>Functionality exists
                    and has been tested aggressively.  Considered GA quality</td></tr>
                <tr><td class="impossible">Impossible</td><td>It is
                    impossible to implement this function.  This may
                    be the case for some functions on some hardware.</td></tr>
                <tr><td class="na">No Applicable</td><td>This code
                    isn't supposed to do this function.  This is used
                    for HPI calls that are entirely handled in the infrastructure.</td></tr>
