            <p>
              OpenHPI is an open source project created with the
              intent of providing an implementation of the <a
                href="http://saforum.org">SA Forum's</a> Hardware Platform
              Interface (HPI). HPI provides an abstracted interface to
              managing computer hardware, typically for chassis and
              rack based servers.  HPI includes a resource modeling;
              access to and control over sensor, control, watchdog,
              and inventory data associated with resources; abstracted
              System Event Log interfaces; hardware events and alerts;
              and a managed hotswap interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              OpenHPI provides a modular mechanism for adding new
              hardware and device support easily.  Many plugins exist
              in the OpenHPI source tree to provide access to various
              types of hardware.  This includes, but is not limited
              to, IPMI based servers, Blade Center, and machines which
              export data via sysfs.  For up to date status on these
              components, please check out the <a
                href="/status/">status page</a>.

              The OpenHPI project is always looking for more

              <h3><img src="./new03.gif">OpenHPI 1.0.0 Stable
                Released! (06/30/2004)</h3>
              <p>
                After a long year of development the OpenHPI Team is
                proud to announce the release of OpenHPI 1.0.0.  This
                release provides support for the SA Forum HPI A.1.1
                specification.  OpenHPI 1.0.0 is available in source
                format from <a
                  href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71730">the SourceForge 
                  file repository</a>.  Binary RPMs for numerous
                platforms will be made available in the coming weeks.
              </p>
              
              <p>OpenHPI 1.0.0 supports the following
                hardware:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>IPMI based servers and blades (via OpenIPMI or
                  IPMIDirect plugins)</li>
                <li>IBM Blade Center (via SNMP Blade Center
                  plugin)</li>
                <li>IBM xSeries servers (via SNMP RSA plugin)</li>
                <li>Linux 2.4 & 2.6 watchdog devices (via watchdog
                  plugin)</li>
                <li>Linux 2.6 systems (via sysfs plugin)</li>
                <li>A Dummy Plugin designed for testing and writing
                  HPI applications</li>
                </ul>
              <p>
                The release contains a number of sample command
                line utilities as example usage of the hpi interface.
                These include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>hpisensor - displays live readings of all sensors
                  discovered</li>
                <li>hpiinv - displays inventory data for all resources
                  which support it</li>
                <li>hpisel - fetches and displays event logs for all
                  resources in the system</li>
                <li>hpipower/hpireset - power cycle or reset resources
                  in the hpi instance</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Along with the release there is a companion SNMP subagent
                (provided separately) which provides an SNMP interface
                to the OpenHPI library.  This allows users of SNMP client
                software to gain access to HPI information quickly and
                easily.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is also an experimental HPI Daemon included
                with the release.  The HPI Daemon is a user of the
                OpenHPI library that provides HPI as a system
                service.  Client applications can link to
                libopenhpiclient which will transparently connect them
                to the HPI Daemon.
              </p>
              <p>
                A complete change list of everything since 0.9
                follows:

                With OpenHPI 1.0.0 released, the OpenHPI team is now
                fully focusing on the new HPI B.1.1 specification.
                Expect to see new development releases in the near
                future.
