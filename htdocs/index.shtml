            <h1>OpenHPI</h1>
            <p>
              Open HPI is an open source project created with the
              intent of providing an implementation of the <a
                href="http://saforum.org">SA Forum's</a> Hardware Platform
              Interface (HPI). HPI provides a universal interface for creating
              resource system models, typically for chassis and rack based
              servers. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, HPI can be used for creating the system model of
              clusters and virtual machines (aka plex86 and UML)
            </p>

              <dd>We are in the process of updating the information on
                the website to more accurately reflect the project
                current status.  This will also mean keeping the high
                level design information much more up to date on the
