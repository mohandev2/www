            <p>
              OpenHPI is an open source project created with the
              intent of providing an implementation of the <a
                href="http://saforum.org">SA Forum's</a> Hardware Platform
              Interface (HPI). HPI provides an abstracted interface to
              managing computer hardware, typically for chassis and
              rack based servers.  HPI includes a resource modeling;
              access to and control over sensor, control, watchdog,
              and inventory data associated with resources; abstracted
              System Event Log interfaces; hardware events and alerts;
              and a managed hotswap interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              OpenHPI provides a modular mechanism for adding new
              hardware and device support easily.  Many plugins exist
              in the OpenHPI source tree to provide access to various
              types of hardware.  This includes, but is not limmitted
              to, IPMI based servers, Blade Center, and machines which
              export data via sysfs.  For up to date status on these
              components, please check out the <a

              <dd>
                We are in progress to OpenHPI 0.4 right now, and lots of
                documentation is being updated.  The functional test suite
                documentation has now been added to the front page.
                The OpenHPI manual now has the beginnings of a plugin
                implementors guide.  Additionally, formatting changes
                have been made to the documentation to fit into the
                website better.
