                <div>
                    OpenHPI is an open source project created with the intent of providing an implementation of the <a href="http://saforum.org">SA Forum</a>'s Hardware Platform Interface (HPI). HPI provides an abstracted interface to managing computer hardware, typically for chassis and rack based servers. HPI includes resource modeling; access to and control over sensor, control, watchdog, and inventory data associated with resources; abstracted System Event Log interfaces; hardware events and alerts; and a managed hotswap interface.
                    <p>OpenHPI provides a modular mechanism for adding new hardware and device support easily. Many plugins exist in the OpenHPI source tree to provide access to various types of hardware. This includes, but is not limited to, IPMI based servers, Blade Center, and machines which export data via sysfs. For up to date status on these components, please check out <a href="http://openhpi.sourceforge.net/status/">the status page</a>.
                    <p>The OpenHPI project is always looking for more participants. If you are interested in using OpenHPI, or taking a part in the evolution of OpenHPI, please <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/openhpi-devel">join our mailing list</a> and <a href="mailto:openhpi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">drop us a line</a>.

                <h4>OpenHPI 1.9.2 Development Release (11/02/2004)</h4>
                <div>
                    Once again, the OpenHpi team is back with another release. OpenHPI 1.9.2, the third development release of the OpenHPI library since 1.9.0 supporting the HPI B.01.01 spec and on the way to the next stable version 2.0.0.
                    <p>Being a development release, various library components are only partially working. The plugins which are known to work are dummy, ipmi, sysfs, watchdog and snmp_bc. More unit tests have been added and numerous bugs have been fixed and features closed. See the changelog below for details. At the base library level, a couple of enhancements of note are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Improved dynamic configuration interface</b> - No need to open a session with saHpiSessionOpen to use this interface now. The library now has much better self-initialization logic to handler this.</li>
                        <li><b>Updated resource presence table utilities</b> - Correct handling of instrument id numbers in sensor RDRs according to the HPI B spec. This goes to enforce the limitations on the sensor instrument id numbers because of reserved id ranges in the new spec.</li>
                    </ul>
                    We invite everyone to download this new release and share your experiences with us. Voice any questions, problems, or suggestions on the OpenHPI mailing list (<a href="mailto:openhpi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">openhpi-devel@lists.sf.net</a>).

              <h4>OpenHPI 1.9.1 Development Release (10/08/2004)</h4>
              <div>
                The OpenHPI Team is proud to announce the release OpenHPI 1.9.1, the
                second development release supporting the HPI B.01.01 spec. This
                development release includes the major new feature of a dynamic
                configure interface. This allows client applications to load plugins
                dynamically during run time, as well as open and close hardware
                connections (handlers) on demand. This interface is still evolving,
                and full documentation will be available soon.
                <p>
                  As this is a development release, many of the components of the OpenHPI tree
                  are in only partially working states. Five plugins are functioning with the
                  new interfaces (dummy, ipmi, sysfs, watchdog, and snmp_bc), and some of the
                  clients have been ported. The OpenHPI daemon, and SNMP subagent are still in
                  process.
                <p>
                  As always, feedback is highly valued. Please post
                  questions and comments to <a
                  href="mailto:openhpi-devel@lists.sf.net">openhpi-devel@lists.sf.net</a>.
                  The complete release notes follow:

                <h4>OpenHPI 1.9.0 Development Release Posted! (09/08/2004)</h4>
                <div>
                    The OpenHPI team is pleased to announce the release of OpenHPI 1.9.0, the first development release on the road towards OpenHPI 2.0.0. The release can be downloaded from the OpenHPI project site.
                    <p>This release includes the following major feature changes:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Support for HPI B.01.01 interface:</b> OpenHPI 1.9.0 now users the HPI B.01.01 interface. As this is not compatible with HPI A.01.01, applications will need to be ported to HPI B in order to work with future versions of OpenHPI. (Note: not all HPI B functions are fully working at this time)</li>
                        <li><b>Threaded Mode:</b> OpenHPI can now be run in a threaded mode by setting OPENHPI_THREADED=YES in the environment before launching an application. This will create an event thread, which will monitor handlers for events, providing a more real time access to information in certain scenarios.</li>
                        <li><b>Much more granular locking:</b> The core OpenHPI library now uses much more granular locking of data structures to ensure thread safety. This should provide greater performance, and allow for reentrant calls to plugins. (Note: with this plugins must now ensure their own thread safety, as OpenHPI doesn't provide it for them.)</li>
                        <li><b>HPI Utilities:</b> A much richer set of HPI Data utilities has been added to the OpenHPI utils library. This includes conversion to string of nearly every defined and enumerated type in HPI B.01.01 as well as numerous validation routines.</li>
                        <li><b>Full Event Storage:</b> Any event or eventlog entry now has any associated Resource or RDRs stored with it as well. This ensures a consistent view of events and their resources during hotswap scenarios.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As this is a development release, many of the components of the OpenHPI tree are in only partially working states. Three plugins are functioning with the new interfaces (dummy, ipmi, and snmp_bc), and some of the clients have been ported. The OpenHPI daemon, and SNMP subagent are still in process, hopefully ready by OpenHPI 1.9.1 (due the end of Sept).
                    <p> As always, feedback is highly valued. Please post questions and comments to <a href="mailto:openhpi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">openhpi-devel@lists.sf.net</a>
                    <p>The complete feature/bug list for OpenHPI 1.9.0 follows:

                <h4>OpenHPI 1.0.0 Stable Released! (06/30/2004)</h4>
                <div>
                    After a long year of development the OpenHPI Team is proud to announce the release of OpenHPI 1.0.0.  This release provides support for the SA Forum HPI A.1.1 specification.  OpenHPI 1.0.0 is available in source format from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71730">the SourceForge file repository</a>.  Binary RPMs for numerous platforms will be made available in the
                    coming weeks.
                    <p>OpenHPI 1.0.0 supports the following hardware:
                    <ul>
                        <li>IPMI based servers and blades (via OpenIPMI or IPMIDirect plugins)</li>
                        <li>IBM Blade Center (via SNMP Blade Center plugin)</li>
                        <li>IBM xSeries servers (via SNMP RSA plugin)</li>
                        <li>Linux 2.4 & 2.6 watchdog devices (via watchdog plugin)</li>
                        <li>Linux 2.6 systems (via sysfs plugin)</li>
                        <li>A Dummy Plugin designed for testing and writing HPI applications</li>
                    </ul>
                    The release contains a number of sample command line utilities as example usage of the hpi interface.
                    These include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>hpisensor - displays live readings of all sensors discovered</li>
                        <li>hpiinv - displays inventory data for all resources which support it</li>
                        <li>hpisel - fetches and displays event logs for all resources in the system</li>
                        <li>hpipower/hpireset - power cycle or reset resources in the hpi instance</li>
                    </ul>
                    Along with the release there is a companion SNMP subagent (provided separately) which provides an SNMP interface to the OpenHPI library.  This allows users of SNMP client software to gain access to HPI information quickly and easily.
                    <p>There is also an experimental HPI Daemon included with the release. The HPI Daemon is a user of the OpenHPI library that provides HPI as a system service.  Client applications can link to  libopenhpiclient which will transparently connect them to the HPI Daemon.
                    <p>A complete change list of everything since 0.9 follows:
                    <pre>
