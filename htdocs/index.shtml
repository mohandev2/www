                <div>
                    OpenHPI is an open source project created with the intent of providing an implementation of the <a href="http://saforum.org">SA Forum</a>'s Hardware Platform Interface (HPI). HPI provides an abstracted interface to managing computer hardware, typically for chassis and rack based servers. HPI includes resource modeling; access to and control over sensor, control, watchdog, and inventory data associated with resources; abstracted System Event Log interfaces; hardware events and alerts; and a managed hotswap interface.
                    <p>OpenHPI provides a modular mechanism for adding new hardware and device support easily. Many plugins exist in the OpenHPI source tree to provide access to various types of hardware. This includes, but is not limited to, IPMI based servers, Blade Center, and machines which export data via sysfs. For up to date status on these components, please check out <a href="http://openhpi.sourceforge.net/status/">the status page</a>.
                    <p>The OpenHPI project is always looking for more participants. If you are interested in using OpenHPI, or taking a part in the evolution of OpenHPI, please <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/openhpi-devel">join our mailing list</a> and <a href="mailto:openhpi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">drop us a line</a>.

                <h3>News</h3>
                <h4>OpenHPI 1.9.0 Development Release Posted! (09/08/2004)</h4>
                <div>
                    The OpenHPI team is pleased to announce the release of OpenHPI 1.9.0, the first development release on the road towards OpenHPI 2.0.0. The release can be downloaded from the OpenHPI project site.
                    <p>This release includes the following major feature changes:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Support for HPI B.01.01 interface:</b> OpenHPI 1.9.0 now users the HPI B.01.01 interface. As this is not compatible with HPI A.01.01, applications will need to be ported to HPI B in order to work with future versions of OpenHPI. (Note: not all HPI B functions are fully working at this time)</li>
                        <li><b>Threaded Mode:</b> OpenHPI can now be run in a threaded mode by setting OPENHPI_THREADED=YES in the environment before launching an application. This will create an event thread, which will monitor handlers for events, providing a more real time access to information in certain scenarios.</li>
                        <li><b>Much more granular locking:</b> The core OpenHPI library now uses much more granular locking of data structures to ensure thread safety. This should provide greater performance, and allow for reentrant calls to plugins. (Note: with this plugins must now ensure their own thread safety, as OpenHPI doesn't provide it for them.)</li>
                        <li><b>HPI Utilities:</b> A much richer set of HPI Data utilities has been added to the OpenHPI utils library. This includes conversion to string of nearly every defined and enumerated type in HPI B.01.01 as well as numerous validation routines.</li>
                        <li><b>Full Event Storage:</b> Any event or eventlog entry now has any associated Resource or RDRs stored with it as well. This ensures a consistent view of events and their resources during hotswap scenarios.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As this is a development release, many of the components of the OpenHPI tree are in only partially working states. Three plugins are functioning with the new interfaces (dummy, ipmi, and snmp_bc), and some of the clients have been ported. The OpenHPI daemon, and SNMP subagent are still in process, hopefully ready by OpenHPI 1.9.1 (due the end of Sept).
                    <p> As always, feedback is highly valued. Please post questions and comments to <a href="mailto:openhpi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">openhpi-devel@lists.sf.net</a>
                    <p>The complete feature/bug list for OpenHPI 1.9.0 follows:
