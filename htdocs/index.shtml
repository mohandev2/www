                <div>
                    OpenHPI is an open source project created with the intent of providing an implementation of the <a href="http://saforum.org">SA Forum</a>'s Hardware Platform Interface (HPI). HPI provides an abstracted interface to managing computer hardware, typically for chassis and rack based servers. HPI includes resource modeling; access to and control over sensor, control, watchdog, and inventory data associated with resources; abstracted System Event Log interfaces; hardware events and alerts; and a managed hotswap interface.
                    <p>OpenHPI provides a modular mechanism for adding new hardware and device support easily. Many plugins exist in the OpenHPI source tree to provide access to various types of hardware. This includes, but is not limited to, IPMI based servers, Blade Center, and machines which export data via sysfs. For up to date status on these components, please check out <a href="http://openhpi.sourceforge.net/status/">the status page</a>.
                    <p>The OpenHPI project is always looking for more participants. If you are interested in using OpenHPI, or taking a part in the evolution of OpenHPI, please <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/openhpi-devel">join our mailing list</a> and <a href="mailto:openhpi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">drop us a line</a>.

		<h4>OpenHPI 2.1.0 Development Release is out! (04/04/2005)</h4>
		<div>
			OpenHPI 2.1.0 is out! This is our first development release since 2.0.0 came out. Following, a summary of the features for this release:
			<ul>
				<li>openhpi-switcher - OpenHPI has 2 different connection libraries, a stand alone version suitable for most purposes, and a client library which connects to an HPI service daemon, needed in more demanding environments. openhpi-switcher manages which one is the default on the system.</li>
				<li>Improved session management in the client library.</li>
				<li>New client, hpitree, shows existing resource topology.</li>
				<li>Ported IPMI pluging to work with the latest OpenIPMI 1.4.x library. With this come fast discovery, physical slot numbers in HPI EntityPath and overall improved IPMI->HPI mapping.</li>

 For Assistance with installing/running the release, feel free to contact us via the mailing list or at #openhpi on irc.freenode.net.
<br><br>
 <strong>Quality and Testing:</strong><br>
 The OpenHPI team has worked very hard to achieve a high-quality implementation.<br>
 As noted above, the current bug count is very low and is primarily in platform support versus interface
 implementation, feature support and/or specification conformance.<br>
 The current release was based on a criteria taking into account both conformance and functional aspects of the code.<br>
<pre>
 Platform: Intel Carrier Grade TIGPR2U Server with IPMI 1.5 .
 OpenHPI Plug-in: IPMI
 OpenIPMI Version: 1.3.16 (latest)
 ----------------
 Conformance results (hpitest):
 ----------------
 Total test cases: 530
 Pass: 341 (64%)
 Fail: 3 (&lt;1%)
 N/A: 186 (35%)

 ----------------
 Functional stats(hpifun):
 ----------------
 Total test cases: 81
 Pass: 51 (63%)
	Fail: 0 (0%)
	N/A: 186 (35%)
<br>
*Note:	N/A means platform does not support tested features.
	IPMI plug-in currently does not support Inventory write/add functionality due to lack of support in
	current supported version of OpenIPMI (1.3.16).  This will be resolved once we start using
	OpenIPMI 1.4.x tree.
