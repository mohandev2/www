              OpenHPI is an open source project, so is continually a
              work in progress.  As OpenHPI 1.0 is a set of 56 APIs,
              which are fullfilled by both the OpenHPI infrastructure
              and OpenHPI plugins.  We will be providing tracking of
              the status of the APIs based on the following key.
