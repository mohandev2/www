            <h1>OpenHPI Contributors Guide</h1>
            <p>
              As OpenHPI is an open source project, it is important
              that a set of style guidelines and standards exist.
              Without this, the project very quickly will turn into a
              pile of mud that is undecypherable by anyone.  This page
              lists the contributor guidelines for the OpenHPI
              project.  Adherence to these guidelines will ensure a
              much more robust OpenHPI project.
            </p>
            <h2>Coding Style</h2>
            <p>
              From day one OpenHPI has adopted the <a
                href="codingstyle.shtml">Linux Kernel Coding
                Style</a> guidelines as the base for it's style.  For the
              convenience of our developers and users, this document
              is reproduced <a
                href="codingstyle.shtml">on our website</a>.  One
              should read it throughly before continuing.  All patches
              must comply to those guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are certain other items not specified in those
              guidelines that the OpenHPI team has standardized on.
              The first is return values from functions. In the grand
              C tradition, return of 0 indicates sucess, return of < 0
              indicates failure.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second is function level documentation.  OpenHPI has
              adopted the gtk/gnome-doc format for function headers.
              This should be included before any function in the code.
              More information on this format will be added soon.
            </p>
