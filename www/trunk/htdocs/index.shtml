            <h1>OpenHPI</h1>
            <p>
              OpenHPI is an open source project created with the
              intent of providing an implementation of the <a
                href="http://saforum.org">SA Forum's</a> Hardware Platform
              Interface (HPI). HPI provides a universal interface for creating
              resource system models, typically for chassis and rack based
              servers. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, HPI can be used for creating the system model of
              clusters and virtual machines (aka plex86 and UML)
            </p>
            <p>
              This project is just starting, so stay tuned for more info.
