                <div>
                    OpenHPI is an open source project created with the intent of providing an implementation of the <a href="http://saforum.org">SA Forum</a>'s Hardware Platform Interface (HPI). HPI provides an abstracted interface to managing computer hardware, typically for chassis and rack based servers. HPI includes resource modeling; access to and control over sensor, control, watchdog, and inventory data associated with resources; abstracted System Event Log interfaces; hardware events and alerts; and a managed hotswap interface.
                    <p>OpenHPI provides a modular mechanism for adding new hardware and device support easily. Many plugins exist in the OpenHPI source tree to provide access to various types of hardware. This includes, but is not limited to, IPMI based servers, Blade Center, and machines which export data via sysfs. For up to date status on these components, please check out <a href="http://openhpi.sourceforge.net/status/">the status page</a>.
                    <p>The OpenHPI project is always looking for more participants. If you are interested in using OpenHPI, or taking a part in the evolution of OpenHPI, please <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/openhpi-devel">join our mailing list</a> and <a href="mailto:openhpi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">drop us a line</a>.

  <h4>OpenHPI 2.0.0 Stable Release (12/31/2004)</h4>
  <div>
      OpenHPI 2.0.0 has been released! This is the first stable release of OpenHPI providing well-tested and robust implementation of the HPI B.01.01 specification.<br>
     <strong>The current stable release provides:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete library and plugin interface support for HPI B spec.</li>
 <li>Improved library configuration with added event queue, alarm table and event log limits.</li>
 <li>Managed and simplified hot-swap support.</li>
 <li>Resource-level Event Log &amp; Domain Alarm Table support.</li>
 <li>Persistent Domain Event Log.</li>
 <li>Sensors, inventory-data &amp; controls.</li>
 <li>Dynamic plug-in load/unload interface allowing for addition and removal of platforms/resouces within a live HPI session.</li>
 <li>IPMI plug-in with support for IPMI 1.0 and 1.5 platforms.</li>   
 <li>BladeCenter plug-in (RSA and SNMP_BC).</li>
 <li>A set of command line utilities exercising the HPI interfaces.</li>
 <li>An Hpi Shell command line utility providing a single client for HPI interfaces</li>
 <li>A large number of bug fixes and feature completions has been achieved. (&lt;20 open bugs)</li>
     </ul>
 <strong>HpiView:</strong><br>
 Bundled with the release is a preview of HpiView, a GTK based GUI application to be run with OpenHPI.<br><br>

 The binaries and source can be obtained by accessing the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71730">Files</a> section in SourceForge.  For convenience a direct link is also available on this web site.<br>
 RPMs for SuSE are provided; however, the build has been tested on RedHat/Fedora as well and Source RPM is provided.<br>
 For Assistance with installing/running the release, feel free to contact us via the mailing list or at #openhpi on irc.freenode.net.
<br><br>
 <strong>Quality and Testing:</strong><br>
 The OpenHPI team has worked very hard to achieve a high-quality implementation.<br>
 As noted above, the current bug count is very low and is primarily in platform support versus interface
 implementation, feature support and/or specification conformance.<br>
 The current release was based on a criteria taking into account both conformance and functional aspects of the code.<br>
<pre>
 Platform: Intel Carrier Grade TIGPR2U Server with IPMI 1.5 .
 OpenHPI Plug-in: IPMI
 OpenIPMI Version: 1.3.16 (latest)
 ----------------
 Conformance results (hpitest):
 ----------------
 Total test cases: 530
 Pass: 341 (64%)
 Fail: 3 (&lt;1%)
 N/A: 186 (35%)

 ----------------
 Functional stats(hpifun):
 ----------------
 Total test cases: 81
 Pass: 51 (63%)
	Fail: 0 (0%)
	N/A: 186 (35%)
<br>
*Note:	N/A means platform does not support tested features.
	IPMI plug-in currently does not support Inventory write/add functionality due to lack of support in
	current supported version of OpenIPMI (1.3.16).  This will be resolved once we start using
	OpenIPMI 1.4.x tree.
