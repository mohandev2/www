            <p>
              OpenHPI is an open source project created with the
              intent of providing an implementation of the <a
                href="http://saforum.org">SA Forum's</a> Hardware Platform
              Interface (HPI). HPI provides an abstracted interface to
              managing computer hardware, typically for chassis and
              rack based servers.  HPI includes a resource modeling;
              access to and control over sensor, control, watchdog,
              and inventory data associated with resources; abstracted
              System Event Log interfaces; hardware events and alerts;
              and a managed hotswap interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              OpenHPI provides a modular mechanism for adding new
              hardware and device support easily.  Many plugins exist
              in the OpenHPI source tree to provide access to various
              types of hardware.  This includes, but is not limited
              to, IPMI based servers, Blade Center, and machines which
              export data via sysfs.  For up to date status on these
              components, please check out the <a
                href="/status/">status page</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The OpenHPI project is always looking for more
              participation.  If you are interested in using OpenHPI,

                We are in progress to OpenHPI 0.4 right now, and lots of
                documentation is being updated.  The functional test suite
                documentation has now been added to the front page.
                The OpenHPI manual now has the beginnings of a plugin
                implementors guide.  Additionally, formatting changes
                have been made to the documentation to fit into the

            <dt class="announce">OpenHPI SNMP Subagent 0.1 Released (12/17/2003)</dt>
            <dd>
              I am pleased to announce the initial release of the OpenHPI
        SNMP Subagent.  This provides an SNMP interface to OpenHPI
        data structures, allowing OpenHPI enabled hardware to be
        accessed and controlled via SNMP.
        
        <ul>
          <li>First release of the HPI SNMP sub-agent.</li>
          <ul>
            Through this subagent one can includes support for multiple 
            different types of hardware including: IPMI, IBM Blade Center 
            (via SNMP), Linux Watchdog devices, and Sysfs based systems.
          </ul>
        <li>Support for full implementation of the HPI-MIB v1.3 
         (included). This means HPI 1.0 instrumentation using 
          HPI-MIB objects in nine tables:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Resource Presence Table entities
                <ul><li>Hotswap capabilities</li></ul>
        <li>Resource Data Records</li>

                </ul>
              <li>Events and System Event Log</li>
          </ul>
        <li><strong>NOTE:</strong> The OID of the HPI-MIB v1.3 is 'experimental.90.'
            This MIB branch location *WILL* change in the next
            release. Consider this a technology review code.</li>
          
          <li>Support for user configurable options:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>update timer for new RPT/RDR/Events</li>
                <li>maximum events held in events row before they are
                  automatically removed</li>
                <li>sending of new found RPT/RDR/Events during startup</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Example code for retrieving instrumentation information
                using SNMP</li>
