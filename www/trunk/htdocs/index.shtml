            <p>
              OpenHPI is an open source project created with the
              intent of providing an implementation of the <a
                href="http://saforum.org">SA Forum's</a> Hardware Platform
              Interface (HPI). HPI provides an abstracted interface to
              managing computer hardware, typically for chassis and
              rack based servers.  HPI includes a resource modeling;
              access to and control over sensor, control, watchdog,
              and inventory data associated with resources; abstracted
              System Event Log interfaces; hardware events and alerts;
              and a managed hotswap interface.
