                <div>
                    OpenHPI is an open source project created with the intent of providing an implementation of the <a href="http://saforum.org">SA Forum</a>'s Hardware Platform Interface (HPI). HPI provides an abstracted interface to managing computer hardware, typically for chassis and rack based servers. HPI includes resource modeling; access to and control over sensor, control, watchdog, and inventory data associated with resources; abstracted System Event Log interfaces; hardware events and alerts; and a managed hotswap interface.
                    <p>OpenHPI provides a modular mechanism for adding new hardware and device support easily. Many plugins exist in the OpenHPI source tree to provide access to various types of hardware. This includes, but is not limited to, IPMI based servers, Blade Center, and machines which export data via sysfs. For up to date status on these components, please check out <a href="http://openhpi.sourceforge.net/status/">the status page</a>.
                    <p>The OpenHPI project is always looking for more participants. If you are interested in using OpenHPI, or taking a part in the evolution of OpenHPI, please <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/openhpi-devel">join our mailing list</a> and <a href="mailto:openhpi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">drop us a line</a>.

		<h4>OpenHPI 2.3.0 Development Release is out! (11/19/2005)</h4>
		<div>
		After a long wait, the first development release since the latest stable version is finally out. The wait was worth it, though, as this release comes with many important fixes and improvements to both the library and plugins.
		<p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>C++ wrappers to SaHpi structures - an experimental set of wrappers has been created that enables coders to use SaHpi strucures using C++ syntax. Check it out under the top cpp directory in the source tree.</li>
			<li>saHpiEventGet Optimization - The code responsible for fetching HPI events has been tightened up and is now leaner, meaner, and quicker. Any delays to get existing events is reduced.</li>
			<li>Improved Blade Center plugin - Much better mappings of hardware have been added to this plugin</li>
			<li>IA64 cleanliness</li>
			<li>Client library improvement - sharing of session ids between threads is now possible (experimental).</li>
		</ul>
		For a complete list of 2.3.0 bugs and features, take a look a the <a href="changelogs/2.3.0.shtml"><b>Changelog for 2.3.0</b></a>
		</div>
		<h4>OpenHPI SNMP Subagent 2.3 released (11/19/2005)</h4>
		<div>
		This is the third stable release this year. A lot of features have been added to the subagent, along with a few bug fixes. Release 2.3.0, the most solid subagent release up to date.
		<p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>

			<li>The MIB now conforms to standards set forth in RFC 2578 and compiles cleanly with various MIB compilers (e.g., SMICng).</li>
			<li>Timestamps are now represented as an Octet string rather than a Counter64.</li>
			<li>All timestamps are now displayed in network-byte order.</li>
			<li>Added mechanisms to convert time from network-byte order to little-endian form and vice versa</li>
			<li>Entry_Count and Entry_Count_Total scalars have been replaced by Active_Entries and Lifetime_Changes, respectively.</li>
			<li>Supports threads by the use of a newly implemented locking mechanism.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>OpenHPI SNMP Subagent 2.2 Stable Released! (10/14/2005)</h4>
		<div>
		The OpenHPI SNMP Subagent 2.2 was released today after several months of improvements and bug fixes. The HPI MIB that it uses was home-grown in the OpenHPI project and has been adopted by the SA Forum as the official HPI SNMP MIB. So come and get the first open source SNMP Subagent for HPI, from the very originators of the HPI MIB, right here.
		<p><strong>Highlighted features:</strong></p>
		<ul>

		<h4>OpenHPI 2.2.0 Stable Release! (09/19/2005)</h4>
		<div>
		OpenHPI 2.2.0 Stable has been released. This is the second stable release this year after several previous development releases. A lot of bug fixes have gone into it, along with all of the new features. 2.2.0 is the most solid and HPI conformant release up to date.<br>
		New features include:
		<ul>
			<li>Improved threaded mode which now automatically discovers resources</li>
			<li>Better gcc-4.0 support</li>
			<li>Multi-domain support in IPMI Direct plugin</li>

		<h4>OpenHPI 2.1.2 Development Release! (07/25/2005)</h4>
		<div>
			This is the third development release since OpenHPI 2.0.0 stable came out. The next release will be 2.2.0 stable.
			This development release has bug fixes across the board. New features include:
			<ul>
				<li>Blade Center plugin - alarm panel support</li>
				<li>HPI Clients - we have a new client to display the domain event log</li>
				<li>IPMI Direct plugin - exposure of all OEM FRU multirecords</li>
				<li>New plugin loader - This will prevent plugins from having to be rebuilt if the plugin abi changes. Furthermore, it prevents segfaults if new functions are added that a plugin doesn't support. Overall, this this makes the plugin abi much more flexible to future changes.</li>
			</ul>

 The binaries and source can be obtained by accessing the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71730">Files</a> section in SourceForge.  For convenience a direct link is also available on this web site.<br>
 RPMs for SuSE are provided; however, the build has been tested on RedHat/Fedora as well and Source RPM is provided.<br>
 For Assistance with installing/running the release, feel free to contact us via the mailing list or at #openhpi on irc.freenode.net.
<br><br>
 <strong>Quality and Testing:</strong><br>
 The OpenHPI team has worked very hard to achieve a high-quality implementation.<br>
 As noted above, the current bug count is very low and is primarily in platform support versus interface
 implementation, feature support and/or specification conformance.<br>
 The current release was based on a criteria taking into account both conformance and functional aspects of the code.<br>
<pre>
 Platform: Intel Carrier Grade TIGPR2U Server with IPMI 1.5 .
 OpenHPI Plug-in: IPMI
 OpenIPMI Version: 1.3.16 (latest)
 ----------------
 Conformance results (hpitest):
 ----------------
 Total test cases: 530
 Pass: 341 (64%)
 Fail: 3 (&lt;1%)
 N/A: 186 (35%)

 ----------------
 Functional stats(hpifun):
 ----------------
 Total test cases: 81
 Pass: 51 (63%)
	Fail: 0 (0%)
	N/A: 186 (35%)
<br>
*Note:	N/A means platform does not support tested features.
	IPMI plug-in currently does not support Inventory write/add functionality due to lack of support in
	current supported version of OpenIPMI (1.3.16).  This will be resolved once we start using
	OpenIPMI 1.4.x tree.
