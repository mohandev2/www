            <h1 align="center">Welcome to OpenHPI's web site!</h1>
            <p>
              OpenHPI is an open source project created with the
              intent of providing an implementation of the <a
              href="http://saforum.org">SA Forum's</a> Hardware
              Platform Interface (HPI). HPI provides an abstracted
              interface to managing computer hardware, typically for
              chassis and rack based servers.  HPI includes a resource
              modeling; access to and control over sensor, control,
              watchdog, and inventory data associated with resources;
              abstracted System Event Log interfaces; hardware events
              and alerts; and a managed hotswap interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              OpenHPI provides a modular mechanism for adding new
              hardware and device support easily.  Many plugins exist
              in the OpenHPI source tree to provide access to various
              types of hardware.  This includes, but is not limited
              to, IPMI based servers, Blade Center, and machines which
              export data via sysfs.  For up to date status on these
              components, please check out the <a
              href="/status/">status page</a>.
            </p>

              The OpenHPI project is always looking for more
              participation.  If you are interested in using OpenHPI,

              <h3><img src="./new03.gif">OpenHPI 1.9.0 Development
                Release Posted! (09/08/2004)</h3>
              <p>
                The OpenHPI team is pleased to announce the release of
                OpenHPI 1.9.0, the first development release on the
                road towards OpenHPI 2.0.0.  The release can be
                downloaded from <a
                  href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71730&package_id=71373&release_id=265507">the OpenHPI project site</a>. 
              </p>
              <p>
                This release includes the following major feature
                changes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Support for HPI B.01.01 interface</b>:
                  OpenHPI 1.9.0 now users the HPI B.01.01 interface.
                  As this is not compatible with HPI A.01.01,
                  applications will need to be ported to HPI B in
                  order to work with future versions of OpenHPI.
                  (Note: not all HPI B functions are fully working at
                  this time)
                </li>
                <li><b>Threaded Mode</b>: OpenHPI can now be run in
                  a threaded mode by setting OPENHPI_THREADED=YES in
                  the environment before launching an application.
                  This will create an event thread, which will monitor
                  handlers for events, providing a more real time
                  access to information in certain scenarios.
                </li>
                <li><b>Much more granular locking</b>: The core
                  OpenHPI library now uses much more granular locking
                  of data structures to ensure thread safety.  This
                  should provide greater performance, and allow for
                  reentrant calls to plugins.  (Note: with this
                  plugins must now ensure their own thread safety, as
                  OpenHPI doesn't provide it for them.)
                </li>
                <li><b>HPI Utilities</b>: A much richer set of HPI
                  Data utilities has been added to the OpenHPI utils
                  library.  This includes conversion to string of
                  nearly every defined and enumerated type in HPI
                  B.01.01 as well as numerous validation routines.
                </li>
                <li><b>Full Event Storage</b>: Any event or eventlog
                entry now has any associated Resource or RDRs stored
                with it as well.  This ensures a consistent view of
                events and their resources during hotswap scenarios.
                </li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                As this is a development release, many of the
                components of the OpenHPI tree are in only partially
                working states.  Three plugins are functioning with
                the new interfaces (dummy, ipmi, and snmp_bc), and
                some of the clients have been ported.  The OpenHPI
                daemon, and SNMP subagent are still in process,
                hopefully ready by OpenHPI 1.9.1 (due the end of Sept).
              </p>
              <p>
                As always, feedback is highly valued.  Please post
                questions and comments to <a
                href="mailto:openhpi-devel@lists.sf.net">openhpi-devel@lists.sf.net</a>.

              <h3>OpenHPI 1.0.0 Stable Released! (06/30/2004)</h3>
              <p>
                After a long year of development the OpenHPI Team is
                proud to announce the release of OpenHPI 1.0.0.  This
                release provides support for the SA Forum HPI A.1.1
                specification.  OpenHPI 1.0.0 is available in source
                format from <a
                href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71730">the
                SourceForge file repository</a>.  Binary RPMs for
                numerous platforms will be made available in the
                coming weeks.
              </p>
              
              <p>OpenHPI 1.0.0 supports the following
                hardware:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>IPMI based servers and blades (via OpenIPMI or
                IPMIDirect plugins)</li> 
                
                <li>IBM Blade Center (via SNMP Blade Center
                plugin)</li> 

                <li>IBM xSeries servers (via SNMP RSA
                plugin)</li> 
                
                <li>Linux 2.4 & 2.6 watchdog devices (via
                watchdog plugin)</li> 
                
                <li>Linux 2.6 systems (via sysfs
                plugin)</li> 

                <li>A Dummy Plugin designed for testing
                and writing HPI applications</li>
                </ul>
              <p>
                The release contains a number of sample command
                line utilities as example usage of the hpi interface.
                These include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>hpisensor - displays live readings of all sensors
                  discovered</li>
                <li>hpiinv - displays inventory data for all resources
                  which support it</li>
                <li>hpisel - fetches and displays event logs for all
                  resources in the system</li>
                <li>hpipower/hpireset - power cycle or reset resources
                  in the hpi instance</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Along with the release there is a companion SNMP subagent
                (provided separately) which provides an SNMP interface
                to the OpenHPI library.  This allows users of SNMP client
                software to gain access to HPI information quickly and
                easily.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is also an experimental HPI Daemon included
                with the release.  The HPI Daemon is a user of the
                OpenHPI library that provides HPI as a system
                service.  Client applications can link to
                libopenhpiclient which will transparently connect them
                to the HPI Daemon.
              </p>
              <p>
                A complete change list of everything since 0.9
                follows:
              </p>

                With OpenHPI 1.0.0 released, the OpenHPI team is now
                fully focusing on the new HPI B.1.1 specification.
                Expect to see new development releases in the near
                future.
              </p>
              <p>
                OpenHPI 1.0.0 was produced by the efforts of a large
