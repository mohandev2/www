This directory is used in the release process. Release steps are given at

During June 2013, sourceforge moved to a new platform and it changed many things.
One key thing was bug/feature numbers were changed from system wide to project wide. Every
project had numbers starting from 1. The old bug numbers which were 7 digits got mapped to 
1,2,3 or 4 digit bug numbers. Old bug numbers mentioned in the old releases are not visible 
easily.  

Only bug numbers(bn) are needed in the new system to reach the bugs page at
https://sourceforge.net/p/openhpi/bugs/"bn"/ (Ex. "bn" = 1800). Older sourceforge needed
group_id(gid) and sub id (pid) also. (Ex. bn=3614068, gid=71730, pid=532251 for 
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid="bn"&group_id="gid"&atid="pid" )

Old to new bug/feature numbers mapping files were created and those files are placed
in this directory for easy cross-reference of bugs/features checkedin during the 
legacy releases. 

Python scripts Execution:
========================

Dependency Packages:
--------------------
There are two dependency Python library packages(mechanize and beautifulsoup) need to be installed. 
These packages are specific to OS(RHEL/SUSE/CentOS etc), specific to OS bit(64-bit/32-bit). 
They can be downloaded from 'http://rpm.pbone.net/'.
Ex:
python-mechanize-0.2.5-1.el6.rf.noarch.rpm
python-BeautifulSoup-3.2.0-1.1.el6.noarch.rpm

Install downloaded rpm packages.

[root@dl380g5-3 Python_scripts]# rpm -ivh python-mechanize-0.2.5-1.el5.rf.noarch.rpm
warning: python-mechanize-0.2.5-1.el5.rf.noarch.rpm: Header V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 6b8d79e6

[root@dl380g5-3 Python_scripts]#
[root@dl380g5-3 Python_scripts]# rpm -ivh python-beautifulsoup-3.2.0-1.el5.rf.noarch.rpm
warning: python-beautifulsoup-3.2.0-1.el5.rf.noarch.rpm: Header V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 6b8d79e6

   1:python-beautifulsoup   ########################################### [100%]
[root@dl380g5-3 Python_scripts]#

NOTE: If required, need to install other dependency package/s, while installing the above required rpms. 
It is different for different OS and their releases.

Proxy Setting:
-------------
Set http proxy before running the script to avoid error.
Ex:
export http_proxy=proxy.loc.company.com:8080


Script Usage:
------------
1)sf2xml_scrape.py
  Navigate to the bugs and features pages for the project capturing all bugs and features closed for a specific release.

  ./sf2xml_scrape.py 3.4.0
  Output: xml_export.xml

2)xml2changelog.py
  This will parse the SF XML export file and print the changelog for the specified version level.
  This will execute sf2xml_parser.py to create intermediate .sf2xml_parser.pyc. sf2xml_parser.py parses xml_export.xml and creates a
  file with tracker data. Non need to execute this script directly.

  ./xml2changelog.py 3.4.0

3)sf2xml_scrape_all_tickets.py
  Navigate to the bugs and features pages for the project capturing all bugs and features for a specific release.
  Before running xml2wiki.py script, need to run sf2xml_scrape_all_tickets.py to get xml_export_all.xml file, 
  which is required as a input to xml2wiki.py script.

  ./sf2xml_scrape_all_tickets.py 3.4.0
  Output: xml_export_all.xml

4)xml2wiki.py
  This will parse the SF XML export file and generate a table showing the status of bugs and feature per release in html.

  ./xml2wiki.py 3.4.0 -f xml_export_all.xml > tracker.wiki

5)wiki2web.py
  Get parsed data from SourceForge tracker in wiki format (tracker.wiki). 
  Then, post that to the wiki on http://www.openhpi.org/Status/OpenhpiBugsFeatures.
  
  ./wiki2web.py


NOTE: Files xml_export.xml and xml_export_all.xml are different and they are used for different purposes.
